# Account Deletion Changes

## Issue
When deleting an account, related users and transactions were not being properly deleted, causing data inconsistency and potential orphaned records.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration Updates (`BankingContext.cs`)
- **Transactions**: Changed from `DeleteBehavior.SetNull` to `DeleteBehavior.Cascade`
  - Now when an account is deleted, all related transactions are automatically deleted
- **User-Account Relationship**: Changed from `DeleteBehavior.Cascade` to `DeleteBehavior.Restrict`
  - Prevents accidental user deletion when there might be multiple accounts
  - The service layer now handles user deletion explicitly

### 2. Service Layer Updates (`BankingService.DeleteAccountAsync`)
- **Complete Data Cleanup**: Now explicitly deletes all related data in proper order:
  1. Card transactions (from related cards)
  2. Account transactions
  3. Cards
  4. Account
  5. Associated user (if it's their only account)

- **Transaction Safety**: Uses database transactions to ensure atomicity
- **Improved Logging**: Better logging for successful deletions and failures
- **Error Handling**: Proper rollback on failures

### 3. Database Migration
- Created migration `FixCascadeDeleteForAccountDeletion` to update foreign key constraints
- Applied the migration to the database

## Expected Behavior After Changes

When calling `DELETE /api/admin/accounts/{id}`:

1. **All card transactions** associated with the account's cards are deleted
2. **All account transactions** are deleted
3. **All cards** associated with the account are deleted
4. **The account** itself is deleted
5. **The associated user** is deleted (only if this was their only account)

## Testing the Changes

### Test Scenario 1: Delete Account with Single User
1. Create an account (this creates a user and 3 cards automatically)
2. Create some transactions (card purchases, money loads, etc.)
3. Delete the account using `DELETE /api/admin/accounts/{id}`
4. **Expected Result**: Account, user, cards, and all transactions are deleted

### Test Scenario 2: Delete Account with Multi-Account User
1. Create a user with multiple accounts
2. Add transactions to one of the accounts
3. Delete one account
4. **Expected Result**: Only the account, its cards, and transactions are deleted; the user remains with other accounts

### Verification Queries
You can verify the cleanup by checking the database tables after deletion:
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users WHERE Id = {userId}`
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Accounts WHERE Id = {accountId}`
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Cards WHERE AccountId = {accountId}`
- `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Transactions WHERE AccountId = {accountId}`

All should return 0 for a properly deleted account (except Users in multi-account scenarios).

## API Endpoints Affected
- `DELETE /api/admin/accounts/{id}` - Now properly cascades all deletions

## Rollback Instructions
If issues arise, you can rollback the migration:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations remove
dotnet ef database update
```

Then restore the previous version of the service code.
